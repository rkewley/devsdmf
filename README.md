Discrete Event Specification (DEVS) Distributed Modeling Framework

Based on the Parallel DEVS framework,
DEVS-DMF explicitly enables asynchronous execution
of distributed models via the actor model of computation.
It is optimized for interoperability of models and flexibility
of deployment, as opposed to performance. The DEVS-DMF
framework provides two simplifying benefits to the simulation
developer. It encapsulates internal state and synchronizes
simulation execution to free the developer to focus on designing
the flow of messages and encoding the state transitions
and outputs generated by their flow. It also provides a natural
model for partitioning the simulation into local processes,
because each DEVS model, as an actor, performs a unit of execution
on a separate thread each time it handles a message.
An additional advantage of this framework is location transparency,
its flexibility to deploy actors in a single Java Virtual
Machine to scale up, or to deploy actors to different containers
in the cloud to scale out.

This project allows the creation of DEVS DMF simulation models.  See the project at https://github.com/rkewley/beanhold for an example simulation created using this system.
